**Al-Risalah** by Imam al-Shafi'i warrants a thorough study as the earliest independent work on usul al-fiqh. Written at the request of 'Abdurrahman b. al-Mahdi, it establishes universal principles accepted by both ahl al-hadith and ahl al-ra'y. It is not written in the style of later books; al-Shafi'i speaks in a way that turns fiqh into a saliqah intertwined with usul.

Before engaging with this seminal text, listen to the recordings of 'Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview and read **The Canonization of Islamic Law** by Ahmad El Shamsy to understand al-Shafi'i's historical context. Listen to the recorded commentary of Yusuf al-Ghafis while studying it. Following this, read al-Shafi'i's other treatises in **al-Umm**: **Ikhtilaf Malik**, which addresses claims of Medinan consensus, **Jima' al-'Ilm**, and **Ibtal al-Istihsan**.
