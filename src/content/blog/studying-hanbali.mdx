This is a comprehensive guide to studying the Ḥanbalī madhhab, inspired by al-ʿAsīrī's posts. While there is no exclusive approach to learning the madhhab, this curriculum aims to provide a general idea of works that should be studied. Many of the following texts are the relied-upon study books covered in detail with a teacher. Once completed, the longer reference works be consulted for research instead. Although this guide primarily focuses on Hanbali texts, it includes essential works from scholars of other madhhabs as well.

<blockquote>
<p>Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this community, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Thereafter, He specified a handful from among them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their opinions. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists refer to their opinions while issuing verdicts.</p>

<p>Our Imam, Abū ʿAbdallāh Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most striving in following the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the dunyā, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.</p>

## Furūʿ al-Fiqh

- Bidayat al-'Abid by 'Abdurrahman b. 'Abdullah al-Ba'li (1192 AH)

Bidayat al-'Abid is often the first text studied as concise primer covering the essentials of 'ibadah, equivalent to Nur al-Idah in the Hanafi madhhab. Read it with the author's commentary, Bulugh al-Qasid. 

An excellent work to supplement this with is al-Aqwal al-Mardiyyah by al-Basyuni, the shaykh of the Hanbalis at al-Azhar in his time. Like Bidayat al-'Abid, it covers the chapters of 'ibadah, but also mentions additional issues, defines important words, and presents basic evidence throughout the book. 

Past the introductory level, the madhhab may be studied in different paths. For someone who only wants a foundation in the madhhab, it suffices to study 'Umdat al-Talib by al-Buhuti before moving onto its commentary, Hidayat al-Raghib by Ibn Qa'id, and studying it as well. These two works can be considered accessible summaries of Zad al-Mustaqni' and al-Rawd al-Murbi' respectively. However, someone intending to study the madhhab in detail should read:

- Dalīl al-Ṭālib by Marʿī b. Yūsuf al-Karmī (1033 AH)

Dalīl al-Ṭālib is one of the clearest and most organized books in the madhhab, and it can be considered equivalent to Mukhtasar al-Quduri. Rely on Muṣṭafā al-Ḥathlān's edition and listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, which are indispensable for clarifying the madhhab's positions. 

The most beneficial commentary on Dalīl al-Ṭālib is Fatḥ Wahhāb al-Mārib by Ibn ʿIwaḍ, which is itself a compilation of earlier commentaries. It also draws from other important books in the madhhab, such as Hidāyat al-Rāghib and the numerous works on Muntahā al-Irādāt and al-Iqnāʿ. 

Among the commentaries Ibn ʿIwaḍ draws from is that of ʿAbdullāh al-Maqdisī, whose father was al-Karmi's nephew and his direct student. The author mentions legal reasoning, evidence, and quotes from a wide range of sources, which makes it ideal to read at the same time or after Fatḥ Wahhāb al-Mārib.

Teachers should reference Nayl al-Mārib by al-Taghlabī with its ḥawāshī and selectively mention important details from them. Nayl al-Marib was historically the most prominent commentary, but its value lies with its hawashi. Their main purpose is to critique the text to arrive at a refined understanding, so they should not be the focus of one's studies.

Complement this by studying Zad al-Mustaqni' by al-Hajjawi, which covers many of the masa'il not mentioned in Dalil al-Talib. This is important for understanding the way issues are explained across different texts. For research on specific issues while studying these two books, reference al-Rawd al-Murbi' by al-Buhuti, which is also the final text studied:

- Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī (1051 AH)

This book is a brilliant commentary on Zād al-Mustaqniʿ by al-Ḥajjāwī, and can be considered equivalent to al-Hidayah in the Hanafi madhhab. It has become an extremely important work in the madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and ifta'. Use Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid's published edition titled Jamʿ al-Raḥīq al-Mushbiʿ, which brings details from other books and clarifies the positions of the madhhab. 

There is a large amount of masāʾil in this book and it requires a long time to study thoroughly. For this reason, it is usually the last book taught cover-to-cover. Both the teacher and student need to understand uṣūl, lughah, and the madhhab's nomenclature to extract the all of its benefits. 

For memorization, use Milḥ al-Nad by Saʿd al-Marrī, a versification of Zād al-Mustaqniʿ, and review with Taqrīb al-Rawḍ al-Murbiʿ by ʿAbdullāh al-Muʿīdī, which reorganizes al-Rawd into question-answer format. Al-Rawd should be read several times in stages, increasingly referencing the other works based on al-Muqni':

Stage I: The first stage is to study al-Rawḍ sentence-by-sentence with the objective of both understanding what is explicit and implicit in the text. An excellent work for this is al-Tashīl al-Muqniʿ by Kāmilah al-Kuwārī, which incorporates many hawashi written on al-Rawd.

For an introduction to comparitive fiqh and contemporary masa'il, read Hatem al-Haj's commentary on al-'Umdah by Ibn Qudamah and listen to his recorded lessons. Also read Ibn Taymiyyah's commentary, which remains one of the most comprehensive works of adillah in the madhab. He makes it a point to mention every recorded opinion and explains whether it is from the riwāyāt, wujūh, or aqwāl from the students of Ahmad. 

Stage II: The next stage is to read it alongside Daqāʾiq Ulī al-Nuhā by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī. This book is the most authoritative text in the madhhab. It is a commentary on Muntahā al-Irādāt by Ibn al-Najjār, which combined al-Muqniʿ by Ibn Qudāmah and al-Tanqīḥ al-Mushbiʿ by al-Mardāwī to produce a single text comprising madhhab's relied-upon positions on each issue.

Reference Kashaf al-Qina' by al-Buhuti, al-Buhuti's commentary on al-Iqna' by al-Hajjawi. It is also an authoritative text in the madhhab, although Daqa'iq Uli al-Nuha usually takes precedence when they differ. When they both agree on an issue, it is the relied-upon opinion of the madhhab. 

Stage III: The final stage is to read al-Rawḍ with the major commentaries of al-Muqniʿ line-by-line. These books provide a balance between studying khilāf ʿālī, which widens one's perspective, and khilāf nāzil, which deepens one's understanding of each farʿ and the subtleties of taʿlīl:

- Al-Mumtiʿ by Ibn al-Munajjā al-Tanūkhī
- Al-Mubdiʿ by Burhān al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ
- Al-Muṭliʿ by Ibn Abī al-Fatḥ al-Baʿlī
- Al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī
- Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr by Ibn Abī ʿUmar al-Maqdisī
- Zawāʾid al-Kāfī wa'l-Muḥarrar by Ibn ʿUbaydan al-Baʿlī

Al-Mubdiʿ achieves a balance between explaining the rationale and transmission of the madhhab's positions. This commentary should be the focus of one's studies. Together with Al-Sharḥ al-Kabīr, it was heavily influential on later scholars. 

Al-Inṣāf by Imam al-Mardāwī is the encyclopedia of internal khilāf within the madhhab. Al-Mardāwī marks the final developmental stage of the madhhab, and his works were relied on to determine the madhhab's relied-upon opinions. In this work, al-Mardawi surveys all of the books written in the madhhab up until his time and weighs the strength of each opinion with regard to the madhhab.

Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr was written by Ibn Abī ʿUmar as a rearrangement of al-Mughnī—a work authored by his uncle Ibn Qudāmah—on the structure of al-Muqniʿ. Al-Mughnī itself is well-known as one of the most comprehensive works of fiqh ever written, allowing the reader to observe how analogy is used, debated, defended, and deconstructed.

It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlālāt and khilāf ʿālī and come out still holding to all of the madhhab's relied-upon positions. However, reading these works this will increase one's respect for the madhhab's scholars and their overall approach.

## Adab

- Mukhtaṣar Minhāj al-Qāṣidīn by Najm al-Dīn b. Qudāmah (689 AH)

This is an abridgement of Minhaj al-Qasidin by Ibn al-Jawzi, a Hanbali recension of Ihya 'Ulum al-Din by al-Ghazali. Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din is one of the most comprehensive works in the tradition; discussing the essentials of 'aqidah, fiqh, adab, and tasawwuf. Like the original text, Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin is divided in four quarters:

- The Quarter of Worship: the virtue, inner meanings, and adab of knowledge, prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimmage, recitation, and emulating the Prophet, may peace and blessings be upon him.
- The Quarter of Everyday Life: the adab of eating, hosting guests, marriage, earning a livelihood, friendship, travel, along with commanding good and forbidding evil.
- The Quarter of Destructive Traits: the identification and treatment of spiritual diseases such as vanity, jealosy, arrogance, showing off, gluttony, lust, pride, and inappropriate anger.
- The Quarter of Virtuous Traits: the cultivation of characteristics that lead to salvation such as constant repentence, patience, gratitude, hope, fear, and trust in Allah, sincerity, and contentment.

Studying this is important for understanding the Shari'ah beyond its external rulings, as covered in fiqh. 

- Mandhumah al-'Adab by Shams al-Din b. 'Abd al-Qawi (699 AH)

This should be read with its most refined commentary, Ghidhāʾ al-Albāb by al-Saffārīnī.

- Al-Ādāb Al-Sharʿiyyah by Shams al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ (763 AH)

## Uṣūl al-Fiqh

- Al-Mukhtaṣarāt Al-Uṣūliyyah by Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid al-Azharī

This is series of three short texts writen by Muhadmmad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid to prepare the student for higher-level works in uṣūl al-fiqh. They were authored in the style of mutūn and require a teacher to extract the meaning of the text. Listen to the author's recorded commentary on the first work, al-Bulghat al-Mufīdah.

Supplement this with Rafʿ al-Malām by Ibn Taymiyyah, a treatise on the asbāb of khilāf, and the recorded commentary of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ. He goes far beyond explaining the text and provides important advice on dealing with khilāf and approaching one's studies. Also read Dawabit Fahm Kalam Ahl al-'Ilm by Hatim al-'Awni, a short work focusing on interpreting the statements of the scholars for any given field.

- Al-Bulbul by Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī (716 AH)

Al-Bulbul is an summary of Ibn Qudāmah's Rawḍat al-Nāẓir, which is his recension of al-Mustaṣfā by al-Ghazālī. Each section contains a brief dialogue, forcing the reader to think over the arguments for any given issue. Follow the recordings of Ḥasan Bukhārī and review using Taysīr Fahm Rawḍat al-Nāẓir by Māsjid al-ʿAskarī, which reorganizes al-Rawdah into question-answer format. For the chapter of qiyas, read al-Aynas bi-Taysir al-Qiyas by Ghazi b. Murshid. Al-Mustaṣfā should be read as well; al-Ghazālī had a talent for explaining any subject he wrote on with clarity.

After this, read the author's own commentary, which is widely regarded as one of the best works ever written in uṣūl al-fiqh. Al-Ṭūfī had a unique, accessible style, and was not afraid to mention his own shortcomings. Also study Sharḥ al-Muqiẓah by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which clarifies many of the issues related to ḥadīth in uṣūl al-fiqh. Then listen to the recordings of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ on Rawḍat al-Nāẓir, which focus on the practical application of uṣūl to fiqh.

- Al-Kawkab Al-Munīr by Ibn al-Najjār al-Futūḥī (972 AH)

This book is the most authoritative work on uṣūl al-fiqh in the madhhab, known for its difficult language. Use Mubarak al-Hathlan's edition of the text itself and read Kamilah al-Kuwari's edition of the author's commentary. Al-Kawkab Al-Munir is one composition in a line of books based off al-Iḥkām by al-Amidi, which should also be studied afterwards. Preface this by reading The Search for God's Law by Bernard Weiss, who summaries many of al-Āmidī's arguments in al-Ihkam.

Supplement this with Ḍawābiṭ Ṣarf al-Amr wa'l-Nahī by Khālid al-ʿOtaybī, which explains which qarāʾin are used to determine whether verbal commands indicate obligation, and likewise for prohibitions. Although this topic is central to uṣūl al-fiqh, it is rarely addressed. Then read al-Naẓar al-Maqāṣidī by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which explains the role objectives of the law have in interpretation, al-Zarkashī's Salāsil al-Dhahab, which covers masa'il not typically mentioned in standard texts, Darʾ al-Qawl al-Qabīḥ by al-Ṭūfī, which goes over the relationship between many issues in ʿaqīdah and uṣūl al-fiqh, ʿIqd al-Manẓūm by al-Qarāfī, which explains the asbāb of ʿumūm, and al-Ghazālī's Shifāʾ al-Ghalīl, which deals with masālik al-ʿillah, an important concept for understanding qiyās.

- Al-Risalah by Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i (204 AH)

Al-Risalah by Imam al-Shafi’i warrants a thorough study as the earliest independent treatise on usul al-fiqh. Written at the request of ‘Abdurrahman b. al-Mahdi, it establishes the universal principles accepted by ahl al-hadith and ahl al-ra’y. Imam Ahmad recommended that others read al-Shafi'i's work, and he kept several versions of the text himself. It was not written in the style of later texts: al-Shafi’i speaks in a way that turns fiqh into a saliqah intertwined with usul. 

Before engaging with al-Risalah, read The Canonization of Islamic Law by Ahmad El Shamsy to understand al-Shafi’i’s historical context and impact on the other madhhabs, then listen to the recordings of ‘Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview of the text. Finally, listen to Yusuf al-Ghafis's recorded ta'liqat while covering the text.

## Sulūk

- Futūḥ al-Ghayb by ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī (561 AH)

- Manāzil al-Sāʾirīn by Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī (481 AH)

- Al-Ghunyah by ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī (561 AH)

## Uṣūl al-Dīn

- Lumʿat al-Iʿtiqād by Ibn Qudāmah al-Maqdisī (620 AH)

This well-known text is often the first work in this subject studied. Listen to the recorded lessons of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī. Supplement this by memorizing al-Durrat al-Muḍiyyah by al-Saffārīnī, a poem summarizing the important principles of Hanbali creed.

- Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān by Shams al-Dīn b. Balbān (1083 AH)

Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān is an abridgement of Nihāyat al-Mubtadiʾīn by Ibn Ḥamdān and one of the most authoritative works in the madhhab. It must be read with its commentary Minḥat al-Raḥmān by ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh which gathers important details scattered across various books. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad al-Sayyid.

Supplement this with al-ʿAyn wa'l-Athar by ʿAbd al-Bāqī al-Baʿlī, which clarifies certain issues that a student of the madhhab should be familiar with. Use Mubārak al-Hathlān's edition and listen to the recordings of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī. After this, study Umm al-Barihin by al-Sanusi with the author's commentary. It is important to understand the framework and terminology of the mutakallimin before moving on.

Another excellent work to read is Hallal al-'Uqad by al-Tufi, which goes over the names of Allah and the matters narrated in Hadith Jibril. His tafsir on ayat related to creed, al-Isharat al-Ilahiyyah, is also an invaluable. Finally, read Mukhtasar al-Mu'tamad by Abu Ya'la, which presents evidence for each of the madhhab's positions.

- Mukhtaṣar Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by Ḥasan b. ʿUmar al-Shaṭṭī (1274 AH)

This is an abridgement of the Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by al-Saffārīnī, his commentary on al-Durrah and one of the most extensive books in the madhhab. Reference Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār itself for more detail and read ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh notes in al-Taqrīrāt al-Ḥanbaliyyah, which follows his critical edition of al-Durrah. 

Complement this by reading al-Idah by Ibn al-Zaghuni and al-Irshad by Ibn 'Aqil. These two works provide the most detailed exposition of Hanbali creed, incorporating both evidence and dialectc. At this point, study two prominent works of kalam in depth: Sharh al-Aqa'id by al-Taftazani with al-Khalwati's hashiyah followed by al-'Aqidah al-Kubra by al-Sanusi with the author's commentary and Ibn Iwad's hashiyah, al-Rawd al-Unaysi.

## Naql al-Madhhab

- Muqaddimāt al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

- Muqaddimāt al-Furūʿ Shams al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ (763 AH)

- Muqaddimāt Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

Study the introductions to al-Inṣāf, al-Furūʿ, and Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ. These provide crucial knowledge surrounding the madhhab and explains the overall framework used mutaʾakhirīn to determine the madhab's relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid on these introductions, which constitutes some of the best commentary on the madhhab available.

- Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid al-Warrāq (403 AH)

Follow this up with Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid, a short work which should be read to understand how the aṣḥāb interpreted the nuṣūṣ of Aḥmad and the terminology that frequently come up in his fatāwā.

- Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl (363 AH)

Then begin reading through Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl. It is a summary of al-Jāmiʿ by al-Khallāl, where he gathered Aḥmad's statements from his students and made tarjīḥ between them. Collect and pursue all the other masāʾil works as well. The most important are those of ʿAbdullāh and Abū Dāwūd, which are the most well-arranged and reliable.

## Ahkam al-Hadith

The main purpose of studying ahkam al-hadith is to understand the various dalalat of narrations.

- ʿUmdat al-Aḥkām by ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Maqdisī (600 AH)

Complement this with Fath al-Astar by 'Abdurrahman al-Ba'li, a commentary on his refinement of al-Suyuti's al-Jami' al-Saghir. In this book, he summarizes al-Suyuti's book by only including narrations which the nuqqad have declared to be sahih or hasan and further restricting them to what has been narrated by Ahmad, al-Bukhari, and Muslim.

After both studying 'Umdat al-Ahkam thoroughly and reaching an intermediate level in usul, study its commentary Ihkam al-Ahkam by Ibn Daqiq al-'Id, a masterpiece in applied usul al-fiqh. Covering this important for understanding how khilaf occurs from different ways of applying the same usul, and not disagreement on what they are. Listen to the recorded commentary of Hasan Bukhari. 

- Al-Muḥarrar by Shams al-Dīn b. ʿAbd al-Hādī (744 AH)

- Al-Musannaf by 'Abd al-Razzaq al-San'ani (211 AH)

## Takhrīj al-Furūʿ

- Al-Qawāʿid by Ibn al-Laḥḥām (803 AH)

## Furūq

- Īḍāḥ al-Dalāʾil by Sharaf al-Dīn al-Zarīrānī (741 AH)

## Qawāʿid

- Taqrīr al-Qawāʿid by Zayn al-Dīn b. Rajab (795 AH)

## Ṭabaqāt

- Mukhtaṣar Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanābilah by Jamīl b. ʿUmar al-Shaṭṭī (1379 AH)

- Al-Manhaj Al-Aḥmad by Mujīr al-Dīn al-ʿUqaylī (928 AH)

This book by al-ʿUqaylī combines all the major works of tabaqat up until the author's time, including Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Abi Ya'la and Dhayl Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Rajab, and arranges their contents in chronological order. Both of these works contain important documents and pieces of information not found elsewhere.
