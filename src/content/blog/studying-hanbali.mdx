This is a comprehensive guide to studying the Hanbali madhhab, inspired by al-Asiri's posts. There is no exclusive way to approach learning the madhhab, and this curriculum is only meant to provide a general idea of the works that should be studied with a qualified teacher. Although it primarily focuses on texts of the Hanbali madhhab, essential readings from scholars of other madhhabs are also included.

<blockquote>
<p>Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this community, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Thereafter, He specified a handful from among them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their opinions. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists refer to their opinions while issuing verdicts.</p>

<p>Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most striving in following the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.</p>

## Furu' al-Fiqh

- 'Umdat al-Talib by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī (1051 AH)

Imam al-Buhuti is the one of the most important figures in the madhhab, and his books determine the relied-upon positions of the madhhab. This was the his last work, composed after a lifetime of teaching and writing. As such, it is the ideal text to begin one's studies with. Teachers and advanced students covering this book should use its commentary Hidayat al-Raghib by Ibn Qa'id. 'Umdat al-Talib and Hidayat al-Raghib can be considered accessible summaries of Zad al-Mustaqni' and al-Rawd al-Murbi', so they provide excellent preparation for eventually studying the latter two works.

Given the opportunity, study Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat by Ibn Balban with an experienced teacher. It contains many masa'il, but its language is very concise and requires explanation. Going through this work will build the necessary skill of understanding concise expressions, and the text is useful for review later on. Teachers and advanced students should use its commentary Kashf al-Mukhaddarat by 'Abdurrahman al-Ba'li. 

- Dalil al-Talib by Mar'i b. Yusuf al-Karmi (1033 AH)

Dalil al-Talib is one of the most well-organized books in the madhhab. It was the main text studied in Sham and often memorized. Rely on the edition of Muṣṭafā al-Ḥathlān and listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, which are indispensable for clarifying the madhhab's positions. 

For review and memorization, use its concise summary al-Kawkab al-Gharib and further versification in al-Asjad al-Dha'ib, both authored by Faysal al-'Ali. Zad al-Mustaqni' is often studied alongside Dalil al-Talib to cover issues not mentioned in the latter, look at issues from a different perspective, and gain familiarity with understanding concise texts. However, it is a difficult book to read and must be explained by a teacher.

The most beneficial commentary on Dalil al-Talib is Fatḥ Wahhāb al-Mārib by Ibn 'Iwad, which is itself a compilation of earlier commentaries. It also draws from other important books in the madhhab, such as Hidayat al-Raghib and the commentaries of Muntaha al-Iradat and al-Iqna'. One of the commentaries that Ibn 'Iwad takes from is that of 'Abdullah al-Maqdisi, whose father was the author's nephew and one of his greatest students. He focuses on mentioning legal reasoning and evidence for many issues, which makes it ideal to read at the same time or after Fath Wahhab al-Marib. 

Teachers should reference Nayl al-Marib by al-Taghlabi with its hawashi and selectively mention important details from it. Hawashi are typically meant to engage with the text critically, and should not be the focus of one's studies.

- Al-Rawd Al-Murbi' by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī (1051 AH)

This book is a brilliant commentary on Zād al-Mustaqniʿ by al-Ḥajjāwī. At this stage, al-Rawd itself is studied as a text. It has become an extremely important work in the madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Use Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid's published edition titled Jamʿ al-Raḥīq al-Mushbiʿ, which brings important details from other books and clarifies the positions of the madhhab. For memorization, use Milh al-Nad by Sa'd al-Marri, a versification of Zad al-Mustaqni', and review with Taqrib al-Rawd al-Murbi' by 'Abdullah al-Mu'īdī, which reorganizes al-Rawd into question-answer format.

There is a large amount of masāʾil in this book and it requires a long time to cover thoroughly. Both the teacher and student need to understand usul, lughah, and the madhhab's nomenclature to extract the full benefit of al-Rawd. It should be read several times in stages, while increasingly referencing other works:

Stage I: The first stage is to study al-Rawd sentence-by-sentence with the objective of both understanding what is explicit and implicit in the text. An excellent work for this is al-Tashil al-Muqni' by Kamilah al-Kuwari.

Stage II: The next stage is to read it alongside Daqa'iq Uli al-Nuha by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti. This book is the most authoritative text in the madhhab. It is a commentary on Muntaha al-Iradat by Ibn al-Najjar, which combined al-Muqni' by Ibn Qudamah and al-Tanqih al-Mushbi' by al-Mardawi to produce a single work on the madhhab's relied-upon positions.

Stage III: The final stage is to cover al-Rawd with the major commentaries of al-Muqni', which Zad al-Mustaqni' was abridged from. These books provide a balance between studying khilāf ʿālī, which widens one's perspective, and khilāf nāzil, which deepens one's understanding of each farʿ and the subtleties of taʿlīl: 

- Al-Mubdiʿ by Burhān al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ
- Al-Mumtiʿ by Ibn al-Munajjā al-Tanūkhī
- Al-Muṭliʿ by Ibn Abī al-Fatḥ al-Baʿlī
- Al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī
- Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr by Ibn Abī ʿUmar al-Maqdisī
- Zawāʾid al-Kāfī wa'l-Muḥarrar by Ibn ʿUbaydan al-Baʿlī

Al-Mubdiʿ achieves a balance between explaining the rationale and transmission of the madhhab's positions. This commentary should be the focus of one's studies. Together with Al-Sharḥ al-Kabīr, it was heavily influential on later scholars. 

Al-Inṣāf by Imam al-Mardāwī is the encyclopedia of internal khilaf within the madhhab. Al-Mardāwī marks the final developmental stage of the madhhab, and his works were relied on to determine the madhhab's relied-upon opinions. 

Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr was written by Ibn Abī ʿUmar as a rearrangement of al-Mughnī—a work authored by his uncle Ibn Qudāmah—on the structure of al-Muqniʿ. Al-Mughnī itself is well-known as one of the most comprehensive works of fiqh ever written, allowing the reader to observe how analogy is used, debated, defended, and deconstructed.

Accompany this by studying al-'Umdah by Ibn Qudamah with the recordings of Abu Bakr Sa'dawi, which focus on comparitive fiqh. He draws from Bidayat al-Mujtahid by Ibn Rushd and explains each issue according to the order found in al-'Umdah. Also read the commentary of Ibn Taymiyyah, which remains one of the most comprehensive works of adillah in the madhab. He makes it a point to mention every opinion within the madhab and explains whether it is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad.

It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlālāt and khilāf ʿālī and come out still holding to all of the madhhab's relied-upon positions. However, reading these works this will increase one's respect for the madhhab's scholars and their overall approach.

## Usul al-Fiqh

- Al-Mukhtasarat Al-Usuliyyah by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahid al-Azhari

This is series of three short texts writen by Muhadmmad 'Abd al-Wahid to prepare the student for higher-level works in usul al-fiqh. They were authored in the style of mutun and require a teacher to extract their full benefit. Listen to the author's recorded commentary on the first text, al-Bulghat al-Mufidah. 

Also read Raf' al-Malam by Ibn Taymiyyah, a treatise on the asbab of khilaf, with the recorded commentary of Yusuf al-Ghafis. He goes beyond explaining the text and provides important advice on dealing with khilaf and approaching one's studies.

- Al-Bulbul by Najm al-Din al-Tufi (716 AH)

Al-Bulbul is an summary of Rawdat al-Nadhir by Ibn Qudamah, which is itself a recension of al-Mustasfa by al-Ghazali. Each section contains a brief dialogue, forcing the reader to think over the arguments for any given issue. Follow the recorded commentary of of Hasan Bukhari and review using Taysir Fahm Rawdat al-Nadhir by Masjid al-'Askari, which organizes the material into question-answer format. Al-Mustasfa should be read simultaneously. Al-Ghazali had a talent for clearly explaining any subject he wrote on.

After this, read the author's own commentary, which is widely regarded as one of the best works ever written in usul al-fiqh. Al-Tufi had a unique, accessible style, and was not afraid to mention his own shortcomings. Also read Sharh al-Muqidhah by Hatim al-'Awni, which clarifies many of the issues related to hadith in usul al-fiqh. Then listen to the recordings of Yusuf al-Ghafis on Rawdat al-Nadhir, which focus on the practical application of usul to issues from al-Rawd al-Murbi'.

- Al-Kawkab Al-Munir by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi (972 AH)

This book is the most authoritative text on usul al-fiqh in the madhhab. It is the result of a long line of works, beginning with al-Ihkam by al-Amidi. Read it with its commentary by the author, which was abridged from al-Tahbir by al-Mardawi. After covering al-Kawkab al-Munir and its commentary, al-Ihkam should also be studied. Preface this by reading The Search for God's Law by Bernard Weiss, who summaries many of al-Amidi's arguments in his book.

Supplement this with Dawabit Sarf al-Amr wa'l-Nahi by Khalid al-Otaybi, which explains which qara'in are used to determine whether verbal commands indicate obligation, and likewise for prohibitions. Although this topic is central to usul al-fiqh, it is rarely addressed. Then read al-Nazar al-Maqasidi by Hatim al-'Awni, which explores how the objectives of the law have a role in interpretation. 

Also read al-Zarkashi's Salasil al-Dhahab, which covers issues not typically mentioned in standard texts, Dar al-Qawl al-Qabih by al-Tufi, to understand the relationship between many issues in 'aqidah and usul al-fiqh, 'Iqd al-Mandhum by al-Qarafi, which explains the asbab of 'umum, and al-Ghazali's Shifa al-Ghalil, which deals with masalik al-'illah, an important concept for understanding qiyas.

## Usul al-Din

- Lum'at al-I'tiqad by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH)

This is a well-known treatise on Hanbali creed and is typically the first work in the subject studied. Listen to the recorded commentary of 'Abdurrahman al-Salti, and memorize al-Durrat al-Mudiyyah by al-Saffarini.

- Qala'id al-Iqyan by Shams al-Din b. Balbān (1083 AH)

Qala'id al-'Iqyan is an abridgement of Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in by Ibn Hamdan and one of the most authoritative works in the madhhab. Listen to the lessons of Muhammad al-Sayyid and read Minhat al-Rahman by 'Abdullah al-'Abdullah, which gathers important details scattered across various books. 

Complement this with al-'Ayn wa'l-Athar by 'Abd al-Baqi al-Ba'li, which clarifies several contentious issues that one should be familiar with. Use the published edition by Mubarak al-Hathlan and listen to the recorded lessons of 'Abdurrahman al-Salti.

- Mukhtasar Lawami' al-Anwar by Hasan b. 'Umar al-Shatti (1274 AH)

This is an abridgement of the voluminous Lawami' al-Anwar by al-Saffarini, one of the most extensive books in the madhhab. It is al-Saffarini's commentary on his poem al-Durrat al-Mudiyyah, which summarizes important principles and beliefs of the Athari creed. Read al-Taqrirat al-Hanbaliyyah by 'Abdullah al-'Abdullah as well, following his critical edition of al-Durrah al-Mudiyyah.

## Naql al-Madhhab

- Muqaddimat al-Insaf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

- Muqaddimat al-Furu' Shams al-Din b. Muflih (763 AH)

- Muqaddimat Tashih al-Furu' by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

Study the introductions to al-Insaf, al-Furu', and Tashih al-Furu'. These provide crucial knowledge surrounding the madhhab and explains the overall framework used muta'akhirin to determine the madhab's relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muhammad 'Abd al-Wahid on these introductions, which constitutes some of the best commentary on the madhhab available.

- Tahdhib al-Ajwibah by Ibn Hamid al-Warraq (403 AH)

Follow this up with Tahdhib al-Ajwibah by Ibn Hamid, a short work which should be read to understand how the ashab interpreted the nusus of Ahmad and the terminology that frequently come up in his fatawa.

- Zad al-Musafir by Ghulam al-Khallal (363 AH)

Then begin reading through Zad al-Musafir by Ghulam al-Khallal. It is a summary of al-Jami' by al-Khallal, where he gathered Ahmad's statements from his students and made tarjih between them. Collect and pursue all the other masa'il works as well. The most important are those of 'Abdullah and Abu Dawud, which are the most well-arranged and reliable.
