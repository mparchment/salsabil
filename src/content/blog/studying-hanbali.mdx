This is a comprehensive guide to studying the Ḥanbalī madhhab, inspired by al-ʿAsīrī's posts. While there is no exclusive approach to learning the madhhab, this curriculum aims to provide a general idea of works that should be studied. Many of the following texts are the traditional study books covered in detail with a teacher. Studying these relied-upon works does not mean accepting everything uncritically; they should be accompanied by extensive reading and research outside formal lessons. Although this guide primarily focuses on texts of the Ḥanbalī madhhab, it also includes essential books from scholars of other madhhabs.

<blockquote>
<p>Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this community, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Thereafter, He specified a handful from among them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their opinions. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists refer to their opinions while issuing verdicts.</p>

<p>Our Imam, Abū ʿAbdallāh Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most striving in following the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the dunyā, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.</p>

## Adab

- Mukhtaṣar Minhāj al-Qāṣidīn by Najm al-Dīn b. Qudāmah (689 AH)

This is an abridgement of Minhaj al-Qasidin by Ibn al-Jawzi, a Hanbali recension of Ihya 'Ulum al-Din by al-Ghazali. Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din is one of the most comprehensive works in the tradition; discussing the essentials of 'aqidah, fiqh, adab, and tasawwuf. Like the original text, Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin is divided in four quarters:

- The Quarter of Worship: the virtue, inner meanings, and adab of knowledge, prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimmage, recitation, and emulating the Prophet, may peace and blessings be upon him.
- The Quarter of Everyday Life: the adab of eating, hosting guests, marriage, earning a livelihood, friendship, travel, along with commanding good and forbidding evil.
- The Quarter of Destructive Traits: the identification and treatment of spiritual diseases such as vanity, jealosy, arrogance, showing off, gluttony, lust, pride, and inappropriate anger.
- The Quarter of Virtuous Traits: the cultivation of characteristics that lead to salvation such as constant repentence, patience, gratitude, hope, fear, and trust in Allah, sincerity, and contentment.

Studying this is important for understanding the Shari'ah beyond its external rulings, which is covered in fiqh. 

- Ghidhāʾ al-Albāb by Shams al-Dīn al-Saffārīnī (1188 AH)

- Al-Ādāb Al-Sharʿiyyah by Shams al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ (763 AH)

## Sulūk

- Futūḥ al-Ghayb by ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī (561 AH)

- Manāzil al-Sāʾirīn by Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī (481 AH)

- Al-Ghunyah by ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī (561 AH)

## Furūʿ al-Fiqh

- ʿUmdat al-Ṭālib by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī (1051 AH)

Imam al-Buhūtī is the one of the most important figures in the madhhab, and his books determine the relied-upon positions of the madhhab. This was the his last work, composed after a lifetime of teaching and writing. As such, it is the ideal text to begin one's studies with. Teachers and advanced students covering this book should use its commentary Hidāyat al-Rāghib by Ibn Qāʾid. ʿUmdat al-Ṭālib and Hidāyat al-Rāghib can be considered accessible summaries of Zād al-Mustaqniʿ and al-Rawḍ al-Murbiʿ, so they provide excellent preparation for eventually studying the latter two works.

Given the opportunity, study Akhṣar al-Mukhtaṣarāt by Ibn Balbān with an experienced teacher. It contains many masāʾil, but its language is very concise and requires explanation. Going through this work will build the necessary skill of understanding concise expressions, and the text is useful for review later on. Teachers and advanced students should use its commentary Kashf al-Mukhaddarat by ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Baʿlī. 

- Dalīl al-Ṭālib by Marʿī b. Yūsuf al-Karmī (1033 AH)

Dalīl al-Ṭālib is one of the most well-organized books in the madhhab. It was the main text studied in Shām and often memorized. Rely on the edition of Muṣṭafā al-Ḥathlān and listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, which are indispensable for clarifying the madhhab's positions. 

For review and memorization, use its concise summary al-Kawkab al-Gharīb and further versification in al-Asjad al-Dhāʾib, both authored by Fayṣal al-ʿAlī. Zād al-Mustaqniʿ is often studied alongside Dalīl al-Ṭālib to cover issues not mentioned in the latter, look at issues from a different perspective, and gain familiarity with understanding concise texts. However, it is a difficult book to read and must be explained by a teacher.

The most beneficial commentary on Dalīl al-Ṭālib is Fatḥ Wahhāb al-Mārib by Ibn ʿIwaḍ, which is itself a compilation of earlier commentaries. It also draws from other important books in the madhhab, such as Hidāyat al-Rāghib and the commentaries of Muntahā al-Irādāt and al-Iqnāʿ. 

One of the commentaries that Ibn ʿIwaḍ draws from is that of ʿAbdullāh al-Maqdisī, whose father was the author's nephew and one of his greatest students. He focuses on mentioning legal reasoning and evidence for many issues, which makes it ideal to read at the same time or after Fatḥ Wahhāb al-Mārib. 

Teachers should reference Nayl al-Mārib by al-Taghlabī with its ḥawāshī and selectively mention important details from it. Ḥawāshī are typically meant to engage with the text critically, and should not be the focus of one's studies.

- Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī (1051 AH)

This book is a brilliant commentary on Zād al-Mustaqniʿ by al-Ḥajjāwī. At this stage, al-Rawḍ itself is studied as a text. It has become an extremely important work in the madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Use Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid's published edition titled Jamʿ al-Raḥīq al-Mushbiʿ, which brings important details from other books and clarifies the positions of the madhhab. For memorization, use Milḥ al-Nad by Saʿd al-Marrī, a versification of Zād al-Mustaqniʿ, and review with Taqrīb al-Rawḍ al-Murbiʿ by ʿAbdullāh al-Muʿīdī, which reorganizes al-Rawḍ into question-answer format.

There is a large amount of masāʾil in this book and it requires a long time to cover thoroughly. Both the teacher and student need to understand uṣūl, lughah, and the madhhab's nomenclature to extract the full benefit of al-Rawḍ. It should be read several times in stages, increasingly referencing other works:

Stage I: The first stage is to study al-Rawḍ sentence-by-sentence with the objective of both understanding what is explicit and implicit in the text. An excellent work for this is al-Tashīl al-Muqniʿ by Kāmilah al-Kuwārī.

Stage II: The next stage is to read it alongside Daqāʾiq Ulī al-Nuhā by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī. This book is the most authoritative text in the madhhab. It is a commentary on Muntahā al-Irādāt by Ibn al-Najjār, which combined al-Muqniʿ by Ibn Qudāmah and al-Tanqīḥ al-Mushbiʿ by al-Mardāwī to produce a single text comprising madhhab's relied-upon positions on each issue.

Stage III: The final stage is to cover al-Rawḍ with the major commentaries of al-Muqniʿ, which Zād al-Mustaqniʿ was abridged from. These books provide a balance between studying khilāf ʿālī, which widens one's perspective, and khilāf nāzil, which deepens one's understanding of each farʿ and the subtleties of taʿlīl: 

- Al-Mubdiʿ by Burhān al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ
- Al-Mumtiʿ by Ibn al-Munajjā al-Tanūkhī
- Al-Muṭliʿ by Ibn Abī al-Fatḥ al-Baʿlī
- Al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī
- Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr by Ibn Abī ʿUmar al-Maqdisī
- Zawāʾid al-Kāfī wa'l-Muḥarrar by Ibn ʿUbaydan al-Baʿlī

Al-Mubdiʿ achieves a balance between explaining the rationale and transmission of the madhhab's positions. This commentary should be the focus of one's studies. Together with Al-Sharḥ al-Kabīr, it was heavily influential on later scholars. 

Al-Inṣāf by Imam al-Mardāwī is the encyclopedia of internal khilāf within the madhhab. Al-Mardāwī marks the final developmental stage of the madhhab, and his works were relied on to determine the madhhab's relied-upon opinions. 

Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr was written by Ibn Abī ʿUmar as a rearrangement of al-Mughnī—a work authored by his uncle Ibn Qudāmah—on the structure of al-Muqniʿ. Al-Mughnī itself is well-known as one of the most comprehensive works of fiqh ever written, allowing the reader to observe how analogy is used, debated, defended, and deconstructed.

Accompany this by studying al-ʿUmdah by Ibn Qudāmah with the recordings of Abū Bakr Saʿdāwī, which focus on comparitive fiqh. He draws from Bidāyat al-Mujtahid by Ibn Rushd and explains each issue according to the order found in al-ʿUmdah. Also read the commentary of Ibn Taymiyyah, which remains one of the most comprehensive works of adillah in the madhab. He makes it a point to mention every opinion within the madhab and explains whether it is from the riwāyāt, wujūh, or aqwāl from the students of Aḥmad.

It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlālāt and khilāf ʿālī and come out still holding to all of the madhhab's relied-upon positions. However, reading these works this will increase one's respect for the madhhab's scholars and their overall approach.

## Uṣūl al-Fiqh

- Al-Mukhtaṣarāt Al-Uṣūliyyah by Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid al-Azharī

This is series of three short texts writen by Muhadmmad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid to prepare the student for higher-level works in uṣūl al-fiqh. They were authored in the style of mutūn and require a teacher to extract their full benefit. Listen to the author's recorded commentary on the first text, al-Bulghat al-Mufīdah.

Also read Rafʿ al-Malām by Ibn Taymiyyah, a treatise on the asbāb of khilāf, with the recorded commentary of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ. He goes beyond explaining the text and provides important advice on dealing with khilāf and approaching one's studies.

- Al-Bulbul by Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī (716 AH)

Al-Bulbul is an summary of Rawḍat al-Nāẓir by Ibn Qudāmah, which is itself a recension of al-Mustaṣfā by al-Ghazālī. Each section contains a brief dialogue, forcing the reader to think over the arguments for any given issue. Follow the recorded commentary of of Ḥasan Bukhārī and review using Taysīr Fahm Rawḍat al-Nāẓir by Māsjid al-ʿAskarī, which organizes the material into question-answer format. Al-Mustaṣfā should be read simultaneously. Al-Ghazālī had a talent for clearly explaining any subject he wrote on.

After this, read the author's own commentary, which is widely regarded as one of the best works ever written in uṣūl al-fiqh. Al-Ṭūfī had a unique, accessible style, and was not afraid to mention his own shortcomings. Also read Sharḥ al-Muqiẓah by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which clarifies many of the issues related to ḥadīth in uṣūl al-fiqh. Then listen to the recordings of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ on Rawḍat al-Nāẓir, which focus on the practical application of uṣūl to issues from al-Rawḍ al-Murbiʿ.

- Al-Kawkab Al-Munīr by Ibn al-Najjār al-Futūḥī (972 AH)

This book is the most authoritative text on uṣūl al-fiqh in the madhhab. It is the result of a long line of works, beginning with al-Iḥkām by al-Āmidī. Read it with its commentary by the author, which was abridged from al-Taḥbīr by al-Mardāwī. After covering al-Kawkab al-Munīr and its commentary, al-Iḥkām should also be studied. Preface this by reading The Search for God's Law by Bernard Weiss, who summaries many of al-Āmidī's arguments in his book.

Al-Risalah by Imam al-Shafi’i warrants a thorough read as the earliest independent treatise on usul al-fiqh. Written at the request of ‘Abdurrahman b. al-Mahdi, it establishes the universal principles accepted by ahl al-hadith and ahl al-ra’y. It is not written in the style of later books: al-Shafi’i speaks in a way that turns fiqh into a saliqah intertwined with usul. 

Before engaging with this work, listen to the recordings of ‘Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview and read The Canonization of Islamic Law by Ahmad El Shamsy to understand al-Shafi’i’s historical context. Then listen to Yusuf al-Ghafis's recorded ta'liqat.

Supplement this with Ḍawābiṭ Ṣarf al-Amr wa'l-Nahī by Khālid al-ʿOtaybī, which explains which qarāʾin are used to determine whether verbal commands indicate obligation, and likewise for prohibitions. Although this topic is central to uṣūl al-fiqh, it is rarely addressed. Then read al-Naẓar al-Maqāṣidī by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which explores how the objectives of the law have a role in interpretation. 

Also read al-Zarkashī's Salāsil al-Dhahab, which covers issues not typically mentioned in standard texts, Darʾ al-Qawl al-Qabīḥ by al-Ṭūfī, to understand the relationship between many issues in ʿaqīdah and uṣūl al-fiqh, ʿIqd al-Manẓūm by al-Qarāfī, which explains the asbāb of ʿumūm, and al-Ghazālī's Shifāʾ al-Ghalīl, which deals with masālik al-ʿillah, an important concept for understanding qiyās.

## Uṣūl al-Dīn

- Lumʿat al-Iʿtiqād by Ibn Qudāmah al-Maqdisī (620 AH)

This is a well-known treatise on Ḥanbalī creed and is typically the first work in the subject studied. Listen to the recorded commentary of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī, and memorize al-Durrat al-Muḍiyyah by al-Saffārīnī.

- Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān by Shams al-Dīn b. Balbān (1083 AH)

Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān is an abridgement of Nihāyat al-Mubtadiʾīn by Ibn Ḥamdān and one of the most authoritative works in the madhhab. Listen to the lessons of Muḥammad al-Sayyid and read Minḥat al-Raḥmān by ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh, which gathers important details scattered across various books. 

Complement this with al-ʿAyn wa'l-Athar by ʿAbd al-Bāqī al-Baʿlī, which clarifies several contentious issues that one should be familiar with. Use the published edition by Mubārak al-Hathlān and listen to the recorded lessons of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī.

- Mukhtaṣar Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by Ḥasan b. ʿUmar al-Shaṭṭī (1274 AH)

This is an abridgement of the voluminous Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by al-Saffārīnī, one of the most extensive books in the madhhab. It is al-Saffārīnī's commentary on his poem al-Durrat al-Muḍiyyah, which summarizes important principles and beliefs of the Atharī creed. Read al-Taqrīrāt al-Ḥanbaliyyah by ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh as well, following his critical edition of al-Durrah al-Muḍiyyah.

## Naql al-Madhhab

- Muqaddimāt al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

- Muqaddimāt al-Furūʿ Shams al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ (763 AH)

- Muqaddimāt Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī (885 AH)

Study the introductions to al-Inṣāf, al-Furūʿ, and Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ. These provide crucial knowledge surrounding the madhhab and explains the overall framework used mutaʾakhirīn to determine the madhab's relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid on these introductions, which constitutes some of the best commentary on the madhhab available.

- Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid al-Warrāq (403 AH)

Follow this up with Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid, a short work which should be read to understand how the aṣḥāb interpreted the nuṣūṣ of Aḥmad and the terminology that frequently come up in his fatāwā.

- Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl (363 AH)

Then begin reading through Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl. It is a summary of al-Jāmiʿ by al-Khallāl, where he gathered Aḥmad's statements from his students and made tarjīḥ between them. Collect and pursue all the other masāʾil works as well. The most important are those of ʿAbdullāh and Abū Dāwūd, which are the most well-arranged and reliable.

## Takhrīj al-Furūʿ

- Al-Qawāʿid by Ibn al-Laḥḥām (803 AH)

## Adillah

- Al-Muḥarrar by Shams al-Dīn b. ʿAbd al-Hādī (744 AH)

- Al-Muntaqā by Majd al-Dīn b. Taymiyyah (652 AH)

## Furūq

- Īḍāḥ al-Dalāʾil by Sharaf al-Dīn al-Zarīrānī (741 AH)

## Qawāʿid

- Taqrīr al-Qawāʿid by Zayn al-Dīn b. Rajab (795 AH)

## Ṭabaqāt

- Al-Manhaj Al-Aḥmad by Mujīr al-Dīn al-ʿUqaylī (928 AH)

This book by al-ʿUqaylī combines all the major works of tabaqat up until the author's time, including Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Abi Ya'la and Dhayl Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Rajab, and arranges their contents in chronological order. Both of these works contain important documents and pieces of information not found elsewhere.
