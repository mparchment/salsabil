This is a comprehensive guide to studying the Ḥanbalī madhhab, inspired by al-ʿAsīrī's posts. There is no exclusive approach to learning the madhhab, and this curriculum only aims to provide a general idea of texts that should be studied. Many of the following texts are the relied-upon study books covered in detail with a teacher, and once completed, longer reference works should be consulted for research instead. Although this guide primarily focuses on the Hanbali madhhab, it also includes some important works from scholars of other madhhabs.

<blockquote>
<p>Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this community, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Thereafter, He specified a handful from among them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their opinions. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists refer to their opinions while issuing verdicts.</p>

<p>Our Imam, Abū ʿAbdallāh Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most striving in following the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the dunyā, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.</p>

<cite>Muwaffaq al-Dīn Abū Muḥammad ʿAbdullāh b. Aḥmad b. Qudāmah al-Maqdisī, Al-Mughnī</cite>
</blockquote>

This curriculum assumes that reader already has a basic level of familiarity in fiqh. An excellent text for this purpose is al-Aqwal al-Mardiyyah by al-Basyuni, the shaykh of the Hanbalis at al-Azhar in his time. Covering the chapters of worship, this book also defines important terms, presents basic evidence, and was written in a way that makes it easy to understand. It is enough for someone who only wants to learn the essentials of the madhhab, and provides a solid foundation for those intending to study further.

## Furūʿ al-Fiqh

### 'Umdat al-Talib by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī

'Umdat al-Talib is usually the first text studied covering every chapter in fiqh. The purpose of this level is to gain a sound conceptualization of what the masa'il are, and 'Umdat al-Talib is the ideal text for this purpose. It was the last work of the author, following a lifetime of teaching and writing on the madhhab's most authoritative books. As such, it presents the relied-upon position on almost every issue.

It should be read with its commentary, Hidayat al-Raghib by Ibn Qa'id, whose teacher was the direct student of al-Buhuti. 'Umdat al-Talib and Hidayat al-Raghib can be considered accessible summaries of Zad al-Mustaqni' and al-Rawd al-Murbi' respectively, so covering them also prepares the reader for a higher level of study. 

### Dalīl al-Ṭālib by Marʿī b. Yūsuf al-Karmī

Dalīl al-Ṭālib is one of the most organized books in the madhhab, and among its clearest as well. Rely on Muṣṭafā al-Ḥathlān's edition and listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, which are indispensable for clarifying the madhhab's positions. The primary focus on this level is learning the evidence and legal reasoning for the madhhab's positions, and Dalil al-Talib's many commentaries fits this well.

The most beneficial commentary on Dalil al-Talib is that of 'Abdullah al-Maqdisi, whose father was the nephew and student of Shaykh Marʿī. In addition to frequently mentioning legal reasoning and evidence, he also brings other views from scholars within the madhhab and quotes from a wide range of sources. This commentary is invaluable for gaining a well-rounded view of the madhhab. 

An important reference is Fath Wahhab al-Marib by Ibn 'Iwad, which is itself a compilation of the early commentaries on Dalil al-Talib. It also draws from other books in the madhhab, such as Hidayat al-Raghib along with the the numerous commentaries on Muntahā al-Irādāt and al-Iqnāʿ. 

Teachers should reference Nayl al-Mārib by al-Taghlabī with its ḥawāshī, and selectively mention relevant details from them. The value of this commentary largely lies in its hawashi, which should not be the main focus of one's studies.

### Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī

This book is a brilliant commentary on Zād al-Mustaqniʿ by al-Ḥajjāwī, and can be considered equivalent to al-Hidayah in the Hanafi madhhab. It has become an extremely important work in the madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and ifta'. Use Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid's published edition titled Jamʿ al-Raḥīq al-Mushbiʿ, which brings details from other books and clarifies the positions of the madhhab. 

There is a large amount of masāʾil in this book and it requires a long time to study thoroughly. For this reason, it is usually the last book taught cover-to-cover. Both the teacher and student need to understand uṣūl, lughah, and the madhhab's nomenclature to extract the all of its benefits. 

For memorization, use Milḥ al-Nad by Saʿd al-Marrī, a versification of Zād al-Mustaqniʿ, and review with Taqrīb al-Rawḍ al-Murbiʿ by ʿAbdullāh al-Muʿīdī, which reorganizes al-Rawd into question-answer format. Al-Rawd should be read several times in stages, increasingly referencing the other works based on al-Muqni'.

#### Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ — Stage I

The first stage is to study al-Rawḍ sentence-by-sentence with the objective of both understanding what is explicit and implicit in the text. An excellent work for this is al-Tashīl al-Muqniʿ by Kāmilah al-Kuwārī, which incorporates many hawashi written on al-Rawd.

For an introduction to comparitive fiqh and contemporary masa'il, read Hatem al-Haj's commentary on al-'Umdah by Ibn Qudamah and listen to his recorded lessons. Also read Ibn Taymiyyah's commentary, which remains one of the most comprehensive works of adillah in the madhab. He makes it a point to mention every recorded opinion and explains whether it is from the riwāyāt, wujūh, or aqwāl from the students of Ahmad. 

#### Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ — Stage II

The next stage is to read it alongside Daqāʾiq Ulī al-Nuhā by Manṣūr b. Yūnus al-Buhūtī. This book is the most authoritative text in the madhhab. It is a commentary on Muntahā al-Irādāt by Ibn al-Najjār, which combined al-Muqniʿ by Ibn Qudāmah and al-Tanqīḥ al-Mushbiʿ by al-Mardāwī to produce a single text comprising madhhab's relied-upon positions on each issue.

Reference Kashaf al-Qina' by al-Buhuti, al-Buhuti's commentary on al-Iqna' by al-Hajjawi. It is also an authoritative text in the madhhab, although Daqa'iq Uli al-Nuha usually takes precedence when they differ. When they both agree on an issue, it is the relied-upon opinion of the madhhab. 

#### Al-Rawḍ Al-Murbiʿ — Stage III

The final stage is to read al-Rawḍ with the major commentaries of al-Muqniʿ line-by-line. These books provide a balance between studying khilāf ʿālī, which widens one's perspective, and khilāf nāzil, which deepens one's understanding of each farʿ and the subtleties of taʿlīl:

- Al-Mumtiʿ by Ibn al-Munajjā al-Tanūkhī
- Al-Mubdiʿ by Burhān al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ
- Al-Muṭliʿ by Ibn Abī al-Fatḥ al-Baʿlī
- Al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī
- Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr by Ibn Abī ʿUmar al-Maqdisī
- Zawāʾid al-Kāfī wa'l-Muḥarrar by Ibn ʿUbaydan al-Baʿlī

Al-Mubdiʿ achieves a balance between explaining the rationale and transmission of the madhhab's positions. This commentary should be the focus of one's studies. Together with Al-Sharḥ al-Kabīr, it was heavily influential on later scholars. 

Al-Inṣāf by Imam al-Mardāwī is the encyclopedia of internal khilāf within the madhhab. Al-Mardāwī marks the final developmental stage of the madhhab, and his works were relied on to determine the madhhab's relied-upon opinions. In this work, al-Mardawi surveys all of the books written in the madhhab up until his time and weighs the strength of each opinion with regard to the madhhab.

Al-Sharḥ Al-Kabīr was written by Ibn Abī ʿUmar as a rearrangement of al-Mughnī—a work authored by his uncle Ibn Qudāmah—on the structure of al-Muqniʿ. Al-Mughnī itself is well-known as one of the most comprehensive works of fiqh ever written, allowing the reader to observe how analogy is used, debated, defended, and deconstructed.

It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlālāt and khilāf ʿālī and come out still holding to all of the madhhab's relied-upon positions. However, reading these works this will increase one's respect for the madhhab's scholars and their overall approach.

## Adab & Suluk

### Mukhtaṣar Minhāj al-Qāṣidīn by Najm al-Dīn b. Qudāmah

This is an abridgement of Minhaj al-Qasidin by Ibn al-Jawzi, a Hanbali recension of Ihya 'Ulum al-Din by al-Ghazali. Al-Ghazali's book is one of the most comprehensive works in the tradition; discussing the essentials of 'aqidah, fiqh, adab, and tasawwuf. Like the original text, Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin is divided in four quarters:

- The Quarter of Worship: the virtue, inner meanings, and adab of knowledge, prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimmage, recitation, and emulating the Prophet, may peace and blessings be upon him.
- The Quarter of Everyday Life: the adab of eating, hosting guests, marriage, earning a livelihood, friendship, travel, along with commanding good and forbidding evil.
- The Quarter of Destructive Traits: the identification and treatment of spiritual diseases such as vanity, jealosy, arrogance, showing off, gluttony, lust, pride, and inappropriate anger.
- The Quarter of Virtuous Traits: the cultivation of characteristics that lead to salvation such as constant repentence, patience, gratitude, hope, fear, and trust in Allah, sincerity, and contentment.

Supplement this with Jala' al-Khatir by 'Abd al-Qadir, a collection of advice to his students similiar to al-Ghazali's Ayyuhal Walad.

### Mandhumah al-'Adab by Shams al-Din b. 'Abd al-Qawi

This should be read with its refined commentary, Ghidhāʾ al-Albāb by al-Saffārīnī. Follow this up by reading an invaluable work on suluk, Futūḥ al-Ghayb by ʿAbd al-Qādir, accompanied by Ibn Taymiyyah's commentary.

### Manāzil al-Sāʾirīn by Abū Ismāʿīl al-Harawī

Read Madarij al-Salikin by Ibn al-Qayyim as well, a rearrangement and commentary on Manāzil al-Sāʾirīn.

Complement this by reading through al-Ādāb al-Sharʿiyyah by Ibn Mufliḥ and al-Ghunyah by ʿAbd al-Qādir. These two books are the most extensive works in the madhhab on adab and suluk respectively.

## Uṣūl al-Fiqh

### Al-Mukhtaṣarāt Al-Uṣūliyyah by Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid al-Azharī

This is series of three short texts writen by Muhadmmad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid to prepare the student for higher-level works in uṣūl al-fiqh. They were authored in the style of mutūn and require a teacher to extract the meaning of the text. Listen to the author's recorded commentary on the first work, al-Bulghat al-Mufīdah.

Supplement this with Rafʿ al-Malām by Ibn Taymiyyah, a treatise on the asbāb of khilāf, and the recorded commentary of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ. He goes far beyond explaining the text and provides important advice on dealing with khilāf and approaching one's studies. Then read Dawabit Fahm Kalam Ahl al-'Ilm by Hatim al-'Awni, a short work focusing on interpreting the statements of the scholars for any given field.

### Al-Bulbul by Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī

Al-Bulbul is an summary of Ibn Qudāmah's Rawḍat al-Nāẓir, which is his recension of al-Mustaṣfā by al-Ghazālī. Each section contains a brief dialogue, forcing the reader to think over the arguments for any given issue. Follow the recordings of Ḥasan Bukhārī and review using Taysīr Fahm Rawḍat al-Nāẓir by Māsjid al-ʿAskarī, which reorganizes al-Rawdah into question-answer format. For the chapter of qiyas, read al-Aynas bi-Taysir al-Qiyas by Ghazi b. Murshid. Al-Mustaṣfā should be read as well; al-Ghazālī had a talent for explaining any subject he wrote on with clarity.

After this, read the author's own commentary, which is widely regarded as one of the best works ever written in uṣūl al-fiqh. Al-Ṭūfī had a unique, accessible style, and was not afraid to mention his own shortcomings. Also study Sharḥ al-Muqiẓah by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which clarifies many of the issues related to ḥadīth in uṣūl al-fiqh. Then listen to the recordings of Yūsuf al-Ghafīṣ on Rawḍat al-Nāẓir, which focus on the practical application of uṣūl to fiqh. 

Finally, read al-Isharat al-Ilahiyyah by al-Tufi, his commentary on select ayat related to usul al-fiqh. This work is especially important for recognizing 'amm intended by khass and khass intended by 'amm.

### Al-Kawkab Al-Munīr by Ibn al-Najjār al-Futūḥī

This book is the most authoritative work on uṣūl al-fiqh in the madhhab, known for its difficult language. Use Mubarak al-Hathlan's edition of the text itself, memorize its versification in Muntaha al-Ma'mul by Khalid al-Ghanami, and read Kamilah al-Kuwari's edition of the author's commentary. Al-Kawkab Al-Munir is one composition in a line of books based off al-Iḥkām by al-Amidi, which should also be studied afterwards. Preface this by reading The Search for God's Law by Bernard Weiss, who summaries many of al-Āmidī's argume nts in al-Ihkam.

Supplement this with Ḍawābiṭ Ṣarf al-Amr wa'l-Nahī by Khālid al-ʿOtaybī, which explains which qarāʾin are used to determine whether verbal commands indicate obligation, and likewise for prohibitions. Although this topic is central to uṣūl al-fiqh, it is rarely addressed. Then read al-Naẓar al-Maqāṣidī by Ḥātim al-ʿAwnī, which explains the role objectives of the law have in interpretation, al-Zarkashī's Salāsil al-Dhahab, which covers masa'il not typically mentioned in standard texts, Darʾ al-Qawl al-Qabīḥ by al-Ṭūfī, which goes over the relationship between many issues in ʿaqīdah and uṣūl al-fiqh, ʿIqd al-Manẓūm by al-Qarāfī, which explains the asbāb of ʿumūm, and al-Ghazālī's Shifāʾ al-Ghalīl, which deals with masālik al-ʿillah, an important concept for understanding qiyās.

### Al-Risalah by Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i

Al-Risalah by Imam al-Shafi'i warrants a thorough study as the earliest independent treatise on usul al-fiqh. Written at the request of 'Abdurrahman b. al-Mahdi, it establishes the universal principles accepted by ahl al-hadith and ahl al-ra'y. Imam Ahmad recommended that others read al-Shafi'i's work, and he kept several versions of the text himself. It was not written in the style of later texts: al-Shafi'i speaks in a way that turns fiqh into a saliqah intertwined with usul. 

Before engaging with al-Risalah, read The Canonization of Islamic Law by Ahmad El Shamsy to understand al-Shafi'i's historical context and impact on the other madhhabs, then listen to the recordings of 'Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview of the text. Finally, listen to Yusuf al-Ghafis's recorded ta'liqat while covering the text.

## Uṣūl al-Dīn

### Lumʿat al-Iʿtiqād by Ibn Qudāmah al-Maqdisī

This well-known text is often the first work in this subject studied. Listen to the recorded lessons of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī. Supplement this by memorizing al-Durrat al-Muḍiyyah by al-Saffārīnī, a poem summarizing the important principles of Hanbali creed.

### Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān by Shams al-Dīn b. Balbān

Qalāʾid al-ʿIqyān is an abridgement of Nihāyat al-Mubtadiʾīn by Ibn Ḥamdān and one of the most authoritative works in the madhhab. It must be read with its commentary Minḥat al-Raḥmān by ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh which gathers important details scattered across various books. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad al-Sayyid.

Supplement this with al-ʿAyn wa'l-Athar by ʿAbd al-Bāqī al-Baʿlī, which clarifies certain issues that a student of the madhhab should be familiar with. Use Mubārak al-Hathlān's edition and listen to the recordings of ʿAbdurraḥmān al-Saltī. After this, study Umm al-Barihin by al-Sanusi with the author's commentary and 'Ali al-'Umari's recorded lessons. Understanding the framework of the mutakallimin is important before moving on. 

An excellent work to read is Hallal al-'Uqad by al-Tufi, which goes over the names of Allah and the matters narrated in Hadith Jibril. Finally, read Mukhtasar al-Mu'tamad by Abu Ya'la, which presents evidence for the madhhab's positions.

### Mukhtaṣar Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by Ḥasan b. ʿUmar al-Shaṭṭī

This is an abridgement of the Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār by al-Saffārīnī, his commentary on al-Durrah and one of the most extensive books in the madhhab. Reference Lawāmiʿ al-Anwār itself for more detail and read ʿAbdullāh al-ʿAbdullāh notes in al-Taqrīrāt al-Ḥanbaliyyah, which follows his critical edition of al-Durrah. 

Follow this up by studying Sharh al-Aqa'id by al-Taftazani with the recorded lessons of Hamza al-Bakri and al-Khalwati's hashiyah. Then read al-'Aqidah al-Kubra by al-Sanusi with the author's commentary and Ibn Iwad's hashiyah al-Rawd al-Unaysi. Finally, read al-Idah by Ibn al-Zaghuni and al-Irshad by Ibn 'Aqil. Both had strong backgrounds in kalam and their works provide the most detailed exposition of Hanbali creed, incorporating both evidence and dialectc. 

## Naql al-Madhhab

- Muqaddimāt al-Inṣāf by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī

- Muqaddimāt al-Furūʿ Shams al-Dīn b. Mufliḥ

- Muqaddimāt Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Mardāwī

Study the introductions to al-Inṣāf, al-Furūʿ, and Taṣḥīḥ al-Furūʿ. These provide crucial knowledge surrounding the madhhab and explains the overall framework used mutaʾakhirīn to determine the madhab's relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid on these introductions, which constitutes some of the best commentary on the madhhab available.

- Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid al-Warrāq

Follow this up with Tahdhīb al-Ajwibah by Ibn Ḥāmid, a short work which should be read to understand how the aṣḥāb interpreted the nuṣūṣ of Aḥmad and the terminology that frequently come up in his fatāwā. 

- Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl

Then begin reading through Zād al-Musāfir by Ghulām al-Khallāl. It is a summary of al-Jāmiʿ by al-Khallāl, where he gathered Aḥmad's statements from his students and made tarjīḥ between them. Collect and pursue all the other masāʾil works as well. The most important are those of ʿAbdullāh and Abū Dāwūd, which are the most well-arranged and reliable.

## Ahkam al-Hadith

### ʿUmdat al-Aḥkām by ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Maqdisī

After both studying an intermediate text in usul and 'Umdat al-Ahkam thoroughly, study its commentary Ihkam al-Ahkam by Ibn Daqiq al-'Id, a masterpiece in applied usul al-fiqh. Covering this is important for understanding how khilaf occurs from different ways of applying the same usul, and not disagreement on what they are. Listen to the recorded commentary of Hasan Bukhari. 

### Al-Muḥarrar by Shams al-Dīn b. ʿAbd al-Hādī

This is an important summary of Ibn al-Daqiq's al-Ilmam by Ibn 'Abd al-Hadi, where he comments on the authenticity of hadith and mentions their 'ilal. For this reason, studying it requires a sufficient background in 'ulum al-hadith beforehand. Listen to the recorded commentary of 'Abdullah al-Sa'd.

Follow this up by reading Sharh al-Ilmam by Ibn al-Daqiq. Although the author passed away before completing it, this book may be considered the best work on tatbiq of usul al-fiqh ever written.

At this point, begin to reference al-Musannaf by 'Abd al-Razzaq al-San'ani. This work gathers hadith along with athar from salaf, bringing discussions in fiqh back to their original scope. 'Abd al-Razzaq was a major teacher of Imam Ahmad and Shah Waliullah mentions that this work forms the asl of his madhhab. 

## Takhrīj al-Furūʿ

### Al-Qawāʿid by Ibn al-Laḥḥām

## Furūq

### Īḍāḥ al-Dalāʾil by Sharaf al-Dīn al-Zarīrānī

## Qawāʿid

### Taqrīr al-Qawāʿid by Zayn al-Dīn b. Rajab

## Ṭabaqāt

### Mukhtaṣar Ṭabaqāt al-Ḥanābilah by Jamīl b. ʿUmar al-Shaṭṭī

### Al-Manhaj Al-Aḥmad by Mujīr al-Dīn al-ʿUqaylī

This book combines all the tabaqat works in the madhhab up until the author's time, including Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Abi Ya'la and Dhayl Tabaqat al-Hanabilah by Ibn Rajab, and arranges their contents in chronological order.
