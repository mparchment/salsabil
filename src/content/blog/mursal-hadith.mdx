The mursal hadith has been a controversial topic of discussion among scholars for over a thousand years. Many scholars of usul accepted the use of a mursal hadith as a binding proof, while the scholars of hadith unanimously rejected it. 

<blockquote>
<p>Upon careful investigation and precise examination of the point of dispute, there is actually no disagreement between the two groups.</p>

<p>Those who accept mursal hadith only do so when the transmitter is known to narrate only from reliable sources. Abu Bakr al-Razi said in his book on principles: "Whoever we know narrates hadith from those whose narration cannot be trusted and whose hadith cannot be transmitted, such mursal hadith are not accepted by us."</p>

<p>Our discussion is only about those who narrate exclusively from established trustworthy narrators. And with this, the disagreement in the issue is resolved, and the evidence from both sides converges. Allah knows best. </p>
